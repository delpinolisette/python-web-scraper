# Python Web Scraper
Python web scraping using BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Scrapy. 

The main application takes in a url, currently Wikipedia, and scrapes it, looking for info from <p> tags. 

Future developments:
1. Dynamically geneerated content web scraping using Selenium 
2. User Dashboard with search capabilities. 

Difficulties and What I've learned:
1. While iterating through tags, need to account for NoneType(s)!
